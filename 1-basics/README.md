# Basics

During this part of the workshop we will get along with Jest - the most popular unit testing framework in the JavaScript world. As a testing framework it allows us opportunity to:
1. Run the tests
1. Make assertions
1. Use helpers to create test handlers (mocks)

# Main topics
1. [Basic assertions](src/1-basic-assertions/README.md)
2. [Building use cases](src/2-building-use-cases/README.md)
3. [Working with objects](src/3-object-comparison/README.md)
4. [Dependency injection and test handlers](src/4-dependency-injection-and-jest-fn/README.md)
