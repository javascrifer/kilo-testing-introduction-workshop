# Basic assertions

During this part we will write our first tests. Main functions:
1. [`describe`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#describename-fn) -> groups several test cases
2. [`it`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#describename-fn) -> function which contains test case
3. [`expect`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#methods) -> function which allows asserts

During this particular example we will use `expect(expectedValue).toBe()` in order to check using strict equality operator (`===`).
